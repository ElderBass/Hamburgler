## Description


### Disclaimers and Future Directions
-----------------------------

I did not have enough time to clean up the code in this repository, thus many of the functions are inefficient, however they all should work perfectly. 

The way I set up this application was for a fictional universe of characters, thus the 'manager' functionality is limited and not what the assignment had intended. In the future, I believe I could find a way to 'Update Employee Managers' and 'View Employees by Manager'. 


    
## Installation

    
This application relies on two main dependencies: mysql and inquirer. To install these packages on your machine, run the following commands:

```
npm i mysql  | npm i inquirer
```

In order to run this application, right click on the 'empTrackerDB.js' file and select 'Open in Integrated Terminal'. In the new terminal that pops up on your window, type the following command:

```
node empTrackerDB.js
```

You will then be taken to main menu of the Employee Tracker app. 
    
    
## Technologies

This is a node application using javascript/JSON for backend functionality. The database was built and stored using MySQL Workbench, and the application itself uses the 'mysql' npm package to connect the javascript with the SQL database. 

The prompts for navigating and utilizing the application were set up with the 'inquirer' npm package. 

All the code for this application was compiled using VS Code.
